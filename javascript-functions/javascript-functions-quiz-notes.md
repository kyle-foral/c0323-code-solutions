## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a function in JavaScript?
Something that can be called back numerous times to run a codeblock.
- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.
The definition of the funtion is the code block written inside of it.
- Describe the parts of a function **call**.
The parts of the function you call are the () next to the function name.
- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?
A function can be defined but nothing will happen. But if you call the function then it will run the code block.
- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?
A parameter is a placehold and an argument is called and ran through the function.
- Why are function **parameters** useful?
To insert information to be ran through the code without having to write it all out.
- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?
It causes the functions to produce a value and stops any more code from being ran.
